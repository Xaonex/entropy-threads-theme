Internal one-liner  
Entropy Threads is a digital-first streetwear label for those who feel misaligned with the algorithmic, polished world—clothing that turns chaos, glitch, and urban decay into a wearable signal.

### 1.2 Brand Pillars

1. Chaos as Identity  
   Clothing as a signifier that you don’t fit the neat, optimized boxes of mainstream culture.

2. Digital-First / Algorithm-Conscious  
   Born from the internet and the static of modern feeds, not just sold online.

3. Limited, Premium, Intentional  
   Fewer pieces, stronger concepts. Limited drops, premium fabrics, no compromise.

## 8. Standalone Pages

### 8.1 Manifesto Page (/pages/manifesto)

Title: Manifesto from the Void

Content outline  
Welcome to the Void  
Entropy Threads isn’t a logo slapped on blanks. It’s a reaction to a world optimized for clicks, not humans.

We were born from digital static, dead malls, late-night train platforms, and endless feeds that all start to look the same. We make streetwear for people who feel misaligned with that reality—and bored of pretending otherwise.

Embrace the Glitch  
Perfection is an aesthetic for people who still believe everything is under control. We don’t. We celebrate the glitch, the compression artifact, the broken light. Each design is a controlled error—a reminder that cracks in the system are where the truth leaks through.

Unravel Trends  
We don’t chase the hype cycle or design for the explore page. Entropy Threads is built for signal, not noise. We create pieces that still feel right when the algorithm moves on. If you’re here, it’s because you’re not waiting to be told what’s in.

Quality Over Quantity  
Fast fashion burns through outfits and attention spans. We refuse both. Every drop is limited, every fabric chosen for weight, feel, and longevity. If you wear Entropy, you’re not buying in—you’re opting out.

This isn’t merch. It’s armor.  
Join us. Wear the noise.

### 8.2 About Page (/pages/about)

Title: What Is Entropy Threads?

Content outline  
Entropy Threads is a digital-first streetwear label exploring the intersection of chaos, technology, and urban decay.

We operate out of the noise—pulling inspiration from glitch art, cyberpunk alleys, lo-fi cityscapes, and the feeling that the world is slightly off its axis.

We’re small by design. We release in drops, not seasons. Each piece is part of a limited signal broadcast from the Void.

If you’ve ever felt more at home backstage than in the spotlight, more comfortable in the night than the day, or more honest in the group chat than on the timeline—this brand is for you.

Designed in [Your City / Country]. Broadcast worldwide.

## 10. Imagery Guidelines

- Mix of: clean product shots (flat or on model), detail close-ups (print texture, stitching), mood shots (urban, night, neon, glitch overlays)
- Consistency: use one or two core environments (studio plus city)  
- Standardize aspect ratio (square or 4:5) for product images  
- Mood: dystopian, glitchy, but products must remain clearly visible

Photography notes  
- Use dark, high-contrast lighting for mood shots, ensure product detail legibility  
- Close-ups for material quality and print texture to support premium positioning

## 12. Implementation Checklist (High-Level)

1. Set global typography and colors according to this README.  
2. Configure navigation and announcement bar text.  
3. Update homepage sections: hero, glitch ticker, “Embrace the Chaos” block, “Latest Transmission” product grid, email capture block, footer text and links.  
4. Create collections using drop naming (DROP_00: SIGNAL LOST, etc.) and add descriptions.  
5. Rename products using [CODE] // [NAME] format and apply product description template.  
6. Create Manifesto and About pages with provided content.

## 13. Naming, Tone, and Launch Notes

- Naming: keep product codes consistent, avoid special characters beyond hyphens and slashes used in `[CODE] // [NAME]`.  
- Tone: equal parts confrontational and poetic. Maintain a confident, slightly sardonic voice across product copy and site microcopy.  
- Launch cadence: use “Drops” rather than seasonal collections to support scarcity and cultural positioning. Announce drops via the Announcement Bar, email capture, and social transmissions.  
- Restock policy: clearly state limited runs and no guaranteed restocks across product pages and footer FAQ to set customer expectations.

## 15. Final Notes & Best Practices

- Maintain design and copy cohesion across pages. Every touchpoint should echo the brand pillars: chaos as identity, digital-first thinking, and limited premium drops.  
- Use product codes and drop handles in internal systems for inventory control and marketing segmentation.  
- Store SEO, product naming, and image standards will help preserve discoverability as drops accumulate.  
- Keep copy concise, evocative, and slightly contrarian to align with the target audience.
